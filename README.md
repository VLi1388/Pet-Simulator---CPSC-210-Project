# My Personal Project: Pet Simulator

This application allows a player to adopt pets, and take care of their pets by managing the status of their pets. Detailed operations of the application is specified in the following:

#### Possible features
- The player can adopt a pet/new pet
- The player can have multiple pets, but they will start with only one pet 
- The player has a profile that documents their *currently owned pets*
- Each pet has its own profile, which consists of *mood*, *hunger*, *thirst*, *accessories*, *discovered preferences*, and *location*
- Interaction with pets: players can **feed**, **pet**, and **interact** (eg. play fetch) with pets
- In game time system: pet status decreases as time passes. Players need to take action to restore stats

This game is intended to be used as a relaxation for anyone who needs a break from work or daily tasks. This project came to mind as I have always been interested in game development, and seeing this assignment, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to explore and implement some of the game ideas I have had in mind already. 

## User Storeis
- As a user, I want to be able to add a pet to my collection of pets by specifying the name
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of pets I currently own
- As a user, I want to be able to see a pets current status
- As a user, I want to be able to equip my pet with an accessory and add that accessory to my pets profile
- As a user, I want to be able to feed, pet, or interact with my pet, and see the changes be reflected in my pets status

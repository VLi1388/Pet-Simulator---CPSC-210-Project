# My Personal Project: Pet Simulator

This application allows a player to adopt pets, and take care of their pets by managing the status of their pets, as specified in the following:

#### Possible features
- Adopt a pet/new pet
- The player can have multiple pets, but they will start with only one pet 
- Displaying *player profile*: listing current pets
- Displaying *pet profile*: lists current stats, accessories and preferences of the pet
- In game time system: pet status decreases as time passes. Players need to take action to restore stats
- Interaction with pets: players can **feed**, **pet**, and **interact** (eg. play fetch) with pets

This project came to mind as I have always been interested in game development, and seeing this assignment, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to explore and implement some of the game ideas I have had in mind already.

## User Storeis
- As a user, I want to be able to add a pet to my collection of pets by specifying the name and initial status
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of pets I currently have
- As a user, I want to be able to see a pets current status
- As a user, I want to be able to equip my pet with an accessory and add that accessory to my pets profile
- As a user, I want to be able to feed, pet, or interact with my pet, and see the changes be reflected in my pets status

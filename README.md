# My Personal Project: Pet Simulator

This application allows a player to adopt pets, and take care of their pets by managing the status of their pets, as specified in the following:

#### Possible features
- Adopt a pet/new pet
- The player can have multiple pets, yet they will start with only one pet (ability to obtain a new pet is determined by the status of the current pet: the player must meet certain requirements to get their next pet, eg. all current pets have a mood>80, hunger>80, etc.)
- Displaying *player profile*: listing current pets
- Displaying *pet profile*: lists current stats and preferences of the pet
- In game time system: pet status decreases as time passes. Players need to take action to restore stats
- Interaction with pets: players can **feed**, **pet**, and **interact** (eg. play fetch) with pets

This project came to mind as I have always been interested in game development, and seeing this assignment, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to explore and implement some of the game ideas I have had in mind already.
